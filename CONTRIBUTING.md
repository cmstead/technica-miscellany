# Contributing #

This is a semi-open, curated collection of stories, writings, books, and aphorsims from the computing trades. The goal of this collection is to be curated rather than comprehensive. When proposing additions to the collection, please consider the following:

Contributions to this collection should:

- Provide insights into the history of computing
- Be unique or otherwise distinct in perspective
- Categorized appropriately

Currently this contains exclusively written works. I am open to introducing a video section as well, for talks given at conferences, meetups, etc, and may actually start work on that in the near future.

## How To Contribute ##

All contributions must be made via pull request. If someone opens an issue it will be considered a point for discussion, and not a contribution to the project.

If you are unable to make a pull request:

1. If you are new to making pull requests, reach out (an issue is fine) and I, or someone else, can help you learn. Everyone was new once, and everyone had to learn. You don't have to feel alone.
2. If you are limited by a disability, please reach out and I, or someone else, can help you.

If you are unsure as to how to include a work, please open an issue so we can discuss it.

## A Note on Hate, and Gatekeeping ##

People contributing to this list may not look, think, live, or act like you do. They may be more or less skilled than you in some way. Tolerance is required.

**Anyone engaging in hate activities (including, but not limited to, speech and/or acts) will be excluded from the project and disallowed from participating.**

Works created with the express intent of excluding a particular group of people from the computing community will not be considered for this list.
