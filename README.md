# Technica Miscellany #

*A collection of memories, stories, writings, aphorisms, and guiding principles from the computing trades*

This is a curated list of various works about and related to the computing trades. This is not programmer specific, though I am a programmer so it may lean that way. The goal of this document is to collect those things which illuminate the culture at the time; have materially influenced the way we think, work, and interact; or could shift the way we look as a group.

This is a glimmer of what [thick culture](https://www.geepawhill.org/2018/10/14/thick-and-thin-culture/) might look like.

## Stories and Other Writings ##

## Aphorisms and Principles ##

*Brooks' Law*

> [...] Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later

*Conway's Law*

> Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure.

*Dijkstra on Abstraction*

> The purpose of abstraction is not to be vague, but to create a new semantic level in which one can be absolutely precise

*Gall's Law*

> A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked.

*Greenspun's tenth rule*

> Any sufficiently complicated C or Fortran program contains an ad hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of half of Common Lisp.

*Hofstadter's Law*

> It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's law.

*Kernighan's Lever*

> Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.

*[Law of Demeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Demeter)* (link)

*Principle of Least Astonishment*

> If a necessary feature has a high astonishment factor, it may be necessary to redesign the feature.
