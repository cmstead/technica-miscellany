# Technica Miscellany
A collection of memories, stories, and aphorisms from the technical trade

## Stories and Other Writings ##

This is a growing list of my favorite stories and short writings on technical practices, and the technical trade in general. Some are humorous, some are illuminating, all are likley a little cheeky.

- [The Abuse of Design Patterns in writing a Hello World Program](https://taskinoor.wordpress.com/2011/09/21/the-abuse-of-design-patterns-in-writing-a-hello-world-program/)
    - Taking design patterns to the extreme, creating a Hello World program in Java -- This is a great one for highlighting that patterns are not always the answer
- [Das Blinkenlights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blinkenlights)
    - The story of a faux-German sign posted to warn people to leave the computers in a supercomputing center alone
- [Fizz-buzz in TypeScript](https://dev.to/gypsydave5/fizz-buzz-in-typescript-7ip)
    - Using ONLY the type system from TypeScript, someone created FizzBuzz
- [A Story About 'Magic'](http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/magic-story.html)
    - One of my favorite stories about technical oddities and electronics

## Aphorisms and Principles ##

Commonly quoted sayings, laws, and other thoughts from people in the trade.

*Brooks' Law*

> [...] Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later

*Conway's Law*

> Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure.

*Dijkstra on Abstraction*

> The purpose of abstraction is not to be vague, but to create a new semantic level in which one can be absolutely precise

*Gall's Law*

> A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked.

*Greenspun's tenth rule*

> Any sufficiently complicated C or Fortran program contains an ad hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of half of Common Lisp.

*Hofstadter's Law*

> It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's law.

*Kernighan's Lever*

> Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.

*[Law of Demeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Demeter)*

*Principle of Least Astonishment*

> If a necessary feature has a high astonishment factor, it may be necessary to redesign the feature.
